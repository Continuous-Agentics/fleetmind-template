# GitHub Apps for FleetMind Agents

## Why GitHub Apps?

FleetMind agents often need to push code, open PRs, and manage issues in their project repos. GitHub Apps are the right tool for this:

- **Scoped to specific repos** — each agent's app is installed only on its own project repo
- **Per-agent audit trail** — commits and API calls appear as `<agent-name>[bot]`, not a shared human account
- **Short-lived tokens** — 1-hour installation tokens auto-renewed on demand; a leaked token expires quickly
- **No seat cost** — GitHub Apps don't consume GitHub licenses

Compared to a shared Personal Access Token (PAT):

| | Shared PAT | GitHub App (per agent) |
|---|---|---|
| **Credential lifetime** | Long-lived (months/years) | 1-hour tokens, auto-renewed |
| **Blast radius** | All repos | Per-agent, per-repo |
| **Audit trail** | One human's identity | Per-agent bot identity |
| **Revocation** | Kills every consumer | Per-agent, independent |
| **Seat cost** | Consumes a GitHub seat | Free |

## Model: One App Per Agent (Default On)

Every FleetMind agent requires its own GitHub App by default, installed only on its project repo. GitHub access is on for all agents unless explicitly disabled.

### Opting an agent out

An agent that never touches code can opt out of GitHub access with the `github_access` flag in `fleet.yaml`. It defaults to `true`:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: triage
    role: worker
    github_access: false   # no GitHub App created or required for this bot
```

When `github_access` is `false`, the `onboard` wizard skips GitHub App creation (Step 5) and SSM credential storage (Step 10) for that agent, and the agent's bootstrap does not expect `github-app/*` SSM parameters. When it's `true` (the default), the agent gets a GitHub App with the permission set resolved from its bot-type defaults (overridable via the per-agent `github_app` block).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Push code, open PRs, manage issues in the agent's project repo |
| **Permissions** | Contents R+W, Pull requests R+W, Issues R+W, Actions R+W, Checks R, Metadata R |
| **Installed on** | Only `<org>/<project-repo>` |
| **Who uses it** | That one agent |

**Example:** A `helloworld` agent in the `myfleet` fleet gets "MyFleet HelloWorld Bot" installed only on `myorg/helloworld`.

## Token Lifecycle

GitHub Apps use a two-step credential flow — no long-lived secrets on disk:

```
Private Key (PEM) → JWT (10 min) → Installation Token (1 hour)
```

1. The agent calls `gh-app-token` which signs a JWT using the app's private key (valid 10 minutes)
2. It exchanges the JWT for a 1-hour **installation access token** via the GitHub API
3. The token is used for git and API operations
4. When the token expires, `gh-app-token` is called again to get a fresh one

Credentials (App ID, Installation ID, PEM) are stored in AWS SSM Parameter Store and fetched at runtime. The PEM is stored as a `SecureString` (encrypted at rest). The agent's IAM role grants read-only access to only its own SSM path.

## SSM Credential Paths

```
/fleetmind/<fleet_name>/agents/<agent_id>/github-app/app-id            (String)
/fleetmind/<fleet_name>/agents/<agent_id>/github-app/installation-id    (String)
/fleetmind/<fleet_name>/agents/<agent_id>/github-app/pem                (SecureString)
```

**Example** for agent `worker` in fleet `myfleet`:
```
/fleetmind/myfleet/agents/worker/github-app/app-id
/fleetmind/myfleet/agents/worker/github-app/installation-id
/fleetmind/myfleet/agents/worker/github-app/pem
```

## Using `gh-app-token`

The `gh-app-token` script is deployed to every agent EC2 at `/usr/local/bin/gh-app-token` by the bootstrap template.

```bash
# Get a 1-hour read+write token for this agent's project repo
gh-app-token

# Explicit (equivalent)
gh-app-token --app project

# Use in a git operation
TOKEN=$(gh-app-token)
git clone "https://x-access-token:${TOKEN}@github.com/myorg/myrepo.git"

# Use for direct API calls
TOKEN=$(gh-app-token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" https://api.github.com/repos/myorg/myrepo/pulls
```

The script reads agent identity from `/etc/fleetmind/agent.env` (written by the bootstrap template) and uses it to construct the SSM path. Override with environment variables for local testing:

```bash
# Local testing — bypass SSM entirely
GH_APP_ID=12345678 \
GH_INSTALLATION_ID=987654321 \
GH_APP_PEM_FILE=~/Downloads/my-bot.pem \
  gh-app-token
```

## Creating a New App

When provisioning a new agent (every agent gets a GitHub App unless it sets `github_access: false`):

### Step 1 — Create the app in the GitHub UI

1. Navigate to your GitHub org: `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/apps/new`
2. Fill in:
   - **App name:** `<FleetName> <AgentName> Bot` (e.g., "MyFleet Worker Bot")
   - **Homepage URL:** `https://github.com/<org>/<project-repo>`
   - **Webhook:** Disabled — uncheck "Active"
3. Set **Repository permissions**:
   - Contents: `Read and write`
   - Pull requests: `Read and write`
   - Issues: `Read and write`
   - Actions: `Read and write`
   - Checks: `Read`
   - Metadata: `Read` (mandatory, auto-selected)
4. **Where can this be installed:** "Only on this account"
5. Click **Create GitHub App**

> Add Workflows or Variables permissions only if your agent needs them — the defaults above are intentionally minimal.

### Step 2 — Generate a private key

On the app's settings page, scroll to **Private keys** and click **Generate a private key**. A `.pem` file downloads to your machine.

### Step 3 — Install on the project repo

1. In the app settings, click **Install App** (left sidebar)
2. Click **Install** next to your org
3. Choose **Only select repositories** → pick `<org>/<project-repo>`
4. Click **Install**
5. Note the **Installation ID** from the URL:
   `https://github.com/organizations/<org>/settings/installations/<INSTALLATION_ID>`

### Step 4 — Store credentials in SSM

> **`--fleet` accepts either a fleet name (`acme-bots`) or a path to the fleet YAML
> (`fleet-acme-bots.yaml`).** Both forms are equivalent — the CLI resolver tries
> the value as a path first, then as a registered fleet name.

**Preferred (CLI):**

```bash
fleetmind github-app store \
  --fleet <path-or-name> \
  --agent <agent_id> \
  --app-id <app-id> \
  --installation-id <installation-id> \
  --pem-file /path/to/private-key.pem
# e.g. --fleet fleet-acme-bots.yaml   OR   --fleet acme-bots
```

Add `--dry-run` to preview what would be written without calling AWS.

**Fallback (bash, no Node runtime required):**

```bash
infra/scripts/store-bot-github-app.sh \
  --fleet <path-or-name> \
  --agent <agent_id> \
  --app-id <app-id> \
  --installation-id <installation-id> \
  --pem-file /path/to/private-key.pem
# e.g. --fleet fleet-acme-bots.yaml   OR   --fleet acme-bots
```

Both methods store:
- `app-id` and `installation-id` as plain `String` parameters
- `pem` as a `SecureString` (encrypted with the default SSM KMS key)

The operation is idempotent — safe to re-run if you rotate the private key.

### Step 5 — Verify

SSH into the agent EC2 and run:

```bash
gh-app-token
# Should print a token string to stdout, and "Token expires: ..." to stderr
```

## Phase 2 (Planned)

Phase 2 will add `fleetmind github-app create` that uses the GitHub App manifest flow to semi-automate Steps 1–3 above. Tracked in issue #<N>.
